<p>This site is just a place for storing documents: poems, essays, short stories, song lyrics, et cetera.</p>

<p>It serves the purpose of showcasing a possible design for a blog, emphasizing first and foremost the content. It also gave me a chance to play around with JQuery to give it a nice and 'modern' UI. This is something I'd like to experiment with more in the future, but this is a pretty good place to start</p>
