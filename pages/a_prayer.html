<h1>A Prayer</h1>

<hr>

<p>God, author of the universe, creator of heaven and earth, sculptor of the landscapes, painter of movement, you continually and ceaselessly redefine the skies and oceans..</p>

<p>Trillions upon trillions of atoms are all but a mere syllable to you.<br />
At the sound of your voice, the cosmos bursts into being, and spins outwards into existence.<br />
Father, out of love overflowing, you created us.<br />
You gave each of us life. What can we do but love you?<br />
God of the very small and the endlessly vast.<br />
You are all that is infinity, encompassing every one of our surest and vaguest notions.</p>

<p>That which is theory, fact, and reality.<br />
All that is known, will be known, and can never be known.<br />
The sciences and the arts, the libraries of men, all that we hold in the realm of human understanding - The physical world and whatever else that exists beyond observation - all things dreamed, imagined and thought - all of this is but a taste.. but a glimpse of the supreme expanse of your being.</p>

<p>All that is known by you, created by you, and exists because you wished it to be so.<br />
Oh the glory of love! All for love, to be loved, and then love in return... Such a simple concept, but all-inclusive, and the importance and weight of it surpasses all understanding!</p>

<p>Of all great mysteries and wonders of creation, it is THIS which never ceases to amaze me. And what a blessing it is to be amazed!<br />
For this realization, and every other step of the process coming before and after, I am thankful.</p>

<p>My heart of gratitude is all I have to offer. My humble sacrifice.</p>

<p>May your will be done. Amen.</p>
