<h1>Infinitely Small</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Derailed by a whisper!
<br>The train leaves its tracks,
<br>set onward, motivated in facts
<br>Catch and Crash, the Vespers!
</p>

<p>
A mountain and a notion!
<br>Both in a glance are lost,
<br>a feat of pride to dust,
<br>with just a hint of motion!
</p>

<p>
Oh God move.. no, speak.. no, breath
<br>with the subtlest air and the smallest care.
</p>

<p>
So infinitely small! God you catch them All!
<br>Each atom stops itâ€™s fall, for the God so infinitely small...
