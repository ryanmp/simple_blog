<h1>My God, you are breaking</h1>

<hr>

<p>My God, you are breaking.
Your eternity is ending. Your beauty: fading.</p>

<p>Your voice careens off the tops of houses at night,
bounced back, CAST! into the vast, dark void.</p>

<p>And what says the universe to You and I?</p>

<p>The trees groan while growing.
The wind is anxious and electric.
Creation, you are going, going, going.
You wield your soul like a weed in soil,
fecund in lightness, I find your roots
Dancing on the tips of the minds of old.</p>

<p>Your story is a word, your syntax sunk
by enlightened sails, and emboldened tails.
A whisper of air breaks semantic’s spell -
the carefully crafted cornerstone of a world at ease...
in past... and passing,
it flees.</p>

<p>“Ah hah!” says the child, his misery mending.</p>
<p>“My Lord!” says the seeker, his humble refrain.</p>
<p>Both now seeing,
 In nature: All is the same. 
And truth is the pattern that spells out it’s name,
in a broken script, in a humble place,
And in a million thoughts all the same.</p>

<p>So What of it? The meanness of meaning,
the manifold paths in this meandering eve.</p>

<p>If “wishful” ever had a part to play, this is it:</p>

<p>Wonder no more, and wish it away.
And may God forgive us... and give us peace...
this day.</p>
