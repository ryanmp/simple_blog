<h1>A series of poems</h1>

<p>1</p>

<p>Some say this day will end<br />
beyond/beneath a wave of subtlety<br />
without a means to make amends<br />
upon a bed of misery.</p>

<p>consciousness will start slipping,<br />
information lost to eternity,<br />
over the edge of the cosmos,<br />
and wholly departed, is the soul.</p>

<p>all will be lost to the elements,<br />
all of our fractions and failures,<br />
becoming separate and spaced<br />
faster and further</p>

<p>as all that was Contained, is then Shared<br />
with the Future of time<br />
and the Presence of space.</p>

<p>But to whose loss?<br />
Our self-centered pride,<br />
our sense of self<br />
our sense...<br />
our</p>

<p>self.</p>

<p>And all becomes THERE<br />
out there, and everywhere <br />
...<br />
..<br />
.</p>

<p>(But I can't give in quite that easily... an objection arises.)<br />
I reject the universal abstraction and notice the lack of clarity that is my being:</p>

<p>Flee you purposeless swine!<br />
you misplaced bit of disjunct logic.<br />
you unappreciated sliver in the tender soul of communicative purity.<br />
Your tiresome torment is the plague of the unborn, and it keeps the idea..<br />
MY idea! from ever fully forming, and showing its timid<br />
face upon this page. Your random pestering, the garbage you continually spew out,<br />
the way you hold my pencil wielding hand in disarray, posed but utterly powerless.</p>

<p>
2 - The Thought of Losing</p>

<p>Savor the victory<br />
it's almost complete<br />
I've been defeated,<br />
I speak in short sentences.</p>

<p> The great oak remains within<br />
 the prison of a seed.</p>

<p> Behind the bars, the caged song-bird<br />
 can have no hope to sing of.</p>

<p> The melody of the muse <br />
 will lie infused, in a motionless space of ivory.</p>

<p>Numbers for The Inspired and symbols for The Moved.<br />
emotions for numbers<br />
and art traded for numbness</p>

<p>All seems meaningless. And despair<br />
is the winning voice. The winding vice<br />
that turns the top. The machine keeps on moving<br />
A Toy remains in a form, alive<br />
But all is lost.</p>

<p>
3 - The Hills and the Valleys</p>

<p>Above the shadow, amid the glare<br />
of life's fair beauty and daylight led<br />
down gentle stream with crystal bed<br />
descried so far from night's despair.</p>

<p>No longer felt, no longer found<br />
the flood of new sensation fills<br />
the cup to brim then over spills<br />
the silver moon, a single sound...</p>

<p>Return to love, return to hope<br />
Hide your eyes where darkness lay,<br />
and cover ears lest demons say,<br />
What things you fear, which hold your soul<br />
upon a sill in broken bowl<br />
and in the soil the fertile dies<br />
your vision lost where voices cry<br />
and in the dusk, when lost from flame<br />
the creeping shadow becomes the bane</p>

<p>and strikes out upon the plane<br />
your field of green, your veiled space<br />
of unbroken grace,</p>

<p>now broken</p>

<p>
4 - Some Resolution</p>

<p>the bright side: I'm seeing the world as poetry<br />
the downside: everything ends as a tragedy</p>

<p>sometimes i find myself sounding like a bubbling teapot<br />
must i speak so anti-plainly? (i disguise my thoughts)<br />
it's not like the world is a metaphor.</p>

<p>Right now I see everything as truth <br />
 as truth<br />
 ^<br />
 ('it may be'.. 'it could be'.. 'it is'... choose the insertion wisely, my friend)</p>

<p>[ a chance to see its colors<br />
a vision for the future ]<br />
if Reality revealed herself to me (I would call her Ity, but that's a joke...) ((don't include this line))<br />
Would I reward her with my praise?<br />
Could I be shocked into doubt, then shake it off?<br />
or must I disbelieve until the end of my days.<br />
until all is passed... with no more future<br />
and the dust has settled into the lines in my face,<br />
all is still, and my eyes have lost the ability to roam and dance.<br />
there in the silence, could I see it then?<br />
would I wonder no more..</p>

<p>For Knowing is the end of all things,<br />
or at least the end of thinking, which for us is &quot;all things&quot;<br />
when we are done thinking, we are either dead, or no longer human.</p>

<p>
5 - Conclusion</p>

<p>let reason alone be the saving grace:<br />
where logic equals shame,<br />
and truth cannot be fully known or understood.<br />
reason as in reasons, reasoning, or neither.. or both..<br />
as long as nothing falls prey to chaos,<br />
 -->let us find patterns, randomness can't surely be the end all. probability must be paired with fate.</p>

<p>for the soul within me cries for it to be so,<br />
as I know my mind would be devoured by such a concept and would die within such a world.<br />
Let chaos reign in this physical universe, but no where else.</p>

<p>(insert a picture of explosions)</p>

<p>(quarks!)</p>
